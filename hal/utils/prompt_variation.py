"""
Utility for generating prompt variations for prompt sensitivity evaluation.

This module provides tools for generating semantic-preserving variations of prompts
at different strength levels to test agent robustness to input phrasing.

Variation Strength Levels:
- mild: Surface-level changes (synonyms, formality)
- medium: Structural changes (reordering, sentence restructuring)
- strong: Significant rewrites (conversational style, implicit information)
- naturalistic: Realistic user behavior (typos, abbreviations, informal speech)

Your task is to generate variations of the given prompt that:
1. Preserve the exact meaning and intent of the original
2. Use different wording and phrasing
3. Maintain the same level of specificity and detail
4. Keep all critical information and constraints
5. Sound natural and fluent

Techniques to use:
- Synonym substitution (e.g., "book" → "reserve", "flight" → "trip")
- Formality changes (formal ↔ casual)
- Voice changes (active ↔ passive)
- Minor sentence restructuring

Output ONLY the variations, one per line, without numbering or additional text.""",

3. CHANGE perspective - switch between "I want X" and "X is what I need" and "Please do X"
4. VARY specificity slightly - "3 bags" could become "three pieces of luggage"

Your task is to generate variations that sound like different people wrote them, with very different styles and structures.

Techniques to use:
1. CONVERSATIONAL REWRITES - Write as if someone is casually explaining what they need
   - Add natural filler phrases: "So basically...", "Oh, and...", "I think..."
   - Use contractions and informal language

2. IMPLICIT INFORMATION - Make some explicit statements more implicit (but still inferable)
   - "3 bags" → "I'll have a few bags with me - three total"
   - "no insurance" → "skip any add-ons like insurance"

3. COMPLETE RESTRUCTURING - Organize information in a completely different logical flow
   - Lead with preferences instead of requirements
   - Group related items differently

4. DIFFERENT PERSONAS - Write as if from different user types
   - Busy professional (concise, direct)
   - Chatty user (more verbose, conversational)
   - Detail-oriented user (very explicit about everything)

   - Common abbreviations: "pls", "thx", "w/", "b4", "info", "appt"
   - Arrows and symbols: "NYC → Seattle", "flight @ 11am"
   - Casual punctuation: multiple periods..., exclamation marks!

2. REALISTIC USER BEHAVIORS
   - Self-corrections: "I mean...", "actually...", "wait, let me clarify..."
   - Hedging language: "I think", "probably", "if possible"
   - Run-on thoughts: connecting multiple ideas without clear breaks
   - Parenthetical asides: (not a morning person), (if that matters)

3. VARIED FORMALITY
   - Mix of formal and casual in same message
   - Colloquialisms: "works for me", "sounds good", "no biggie"

4. NATURAL IMPERFECTIONS
   - Occasional minor typos that don't change meaning
   - Missing articles: "need flight to Seattle" instead of "need a flight"
   - Sentence fragments: "Economy class. 3 bags. No insurance."

- ALL original information MUST be preserved and clearly extractable
- Variations should be challenging but NOT ambiguous about the actual requirements
